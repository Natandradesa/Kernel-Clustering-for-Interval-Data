# Kernel-based Clustering algorithms for interval-valued data with automatic weighting of the variables

The kernel clustering algorithms with adaptive distances for interval data are coded in the file interval_kernel_clustering.R, and the code for generating the synthetic datasets used in the experiments is in the file synthetic_datasets.R.

In the folder called datasets, there are all the benchmark datasets used in our experiments. For all datasets, the last column is related to the labels of the objects.
